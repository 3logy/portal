# VETKey Introduction

## Overview
Verifiable encrypted threshold keys (vetKeys) provide a variety of functionailty. In this section you will find guides to build different applications, but first, it's important to know what the vetKey feature provides, and what are the core assumptions under which we operate. 

## Trust Assumptions
What level of trust do we assume from the canister. 

A decrypted vetKD key (obtained in encrypted form via IC method `vetkd_encrypted_key`), potentially together with it's public part (obtained via IC method `vetkd_public_key`) can be used for a variety of use cases, some of which are described in the following pages.
