# Launching the SNS in production
This describes the detailed steps for launching an SNS.

:::caution

In the following steps we assume that you have already 
[collected the developer and airdrop principals and chosen
the initial SNS parameters in a .yaml file](predeployment.md).
We also recommend that before following these steps and launch an
SNS in production, you have [tested the SNS](local-testing.md).

:::

You are now ready to launch your SNS. 
1. Make a call to the SNS wasm modules canister on the 
NNS subnet to initialise your SNS. To do so, follow the instructions [here](TODO).
   //TODO: add link
   
2. 


// for readme, say you might want to try to upgrade dapp by sns before starting the sale. probably even before removing yourself as controller!!!

so detailed steps should include removing controller
nd then also adding dapp to sns,
which only be possible after removed


add sns controller
try upgrade
remove self as controller
add dapp to sns by proposal
try upgrade
make sale proposal
